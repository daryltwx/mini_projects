# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").


# Getting today's date
date, time = datetime.now().split(" ")

today = date.today()

# Getting stock details 
stock_response = requests.get(url=API_ENDPOINT, params=stock_parameters)

# Date format from API is eg: "2023-11-08"

if percentage_change_in_stock_prices >= 5:
    print("Get News")



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 
news_response = requests.get(url=NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters)
news_data = news_response.json()

# Loops 3 times then?
for days_data in news_slice:

    news_url = days_data["source"]["url"]

news_dict = {days_data["source"]["title"]: days_data["source"]["url"] for days_data in news_slice}


# Format
# {stock}
# 


## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number. 


#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
